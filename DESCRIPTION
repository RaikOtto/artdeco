Description: This packages determines the similarity cancer sample
 transcriptomes to samples with known differentiation stage. Training data input 
 are healthy training scRNA samples and either RNA-seq Bulk or microarray data. 
 The output is an estimate of the input's similarity to pre-trained differentiated stages.
